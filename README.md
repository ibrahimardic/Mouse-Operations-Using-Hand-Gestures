# Mouse Operations Using Hand Gestures Project
 Operating Mouse with hand gestures instead of using physical Mouse. There are 6 operations: Right and Left movement, Up and Down movement, Right Click and Left Click. Operations depends on your hand gesture. For movement operations, the program moves the mouse cursor based on the position of your index finger in the bounding box. For clicking operations, the program determines whether to perform click actions based on the proximity of the distance between your two fingers. When the click mode is activated (both fingers raised), the mouse cursor stops moving,so it makes it a easier to use.
